# Kodiak

I build Linux systems, small tools, and infrastructure with a focus on stability, predictability, and clear organization. My work centers around Nix, Rust, and practical system design.

This account represents the engineering side of Onyx Digital Intelligence Development. Most of the work here is long-term, slow-moving, and intended for real use rather than demos or experiments.

## Projects

OnyxOSV  
A NixOS-based operating system with an emphasis on clean module structure, reproducible builds, and a stable installation path. Flakes are used as tools to maintain clarity and rollback capability, not as an end in themselves.

Alopex  
A network management system written in Rust. The goal is to replace NetworkManager with something smaller, more predictable, and easier to integrate directly into the system and UI layer.

Vacuum Launcher  
A Rust + Iced desktop application acting as a central control panel for the system. Designed to stay minimal and consistent, not decorative.

Exom  
A collaborative environment for developers. Local-first, native, and integrated with the system. The intention is to create a working space rather than another web platform.

OSV Modules  
A collection of reusable NixOS modules used across OnyxOSV. Kept separate to maintain clarity and avoid bloated system configurations.

## How I work

Languages and tools I use regularly:

Rust  
Nix  
Neovim  
Ghostty  
Wayland with Niri  
Waybar with minimal configuration

The priority is straightforward, maintainable code over shortcuts. I try to structure work so it can be read and understood months later without digging through clutter.
